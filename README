Welcome to the Vargo repository! I hope you will be loving it!

This repository contains perl script(s) that retrieve data from MGE by
querying the following MGE website.

http://www.mge.com/customer-service/home/average-use-cost/

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The repository contains the following directory structure:

.
├── data
│   └── README
├── email
│   └── Vargo-2015-04-09
├── perl
│   └── getData.pl
└── README

In getData.pl variables are defined for the house 514 S. Baldwin St.
In the future we will include a front end to the script that reads in
addresses from some sort of database.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Usage:

sgy@jhsph-box:~$ cd Vargo
sgy@jhsph-box:~/Vargo$ perl ./perl/getData.pl 
High: 750
Low: 311
Average: 497

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Future plans:
  Switch to python or R
  Increase efficiency by avoiding the reading/writing of
  ./data/results.html
  Link to a database of addresses
  Test behavior if errors are encountered due to:
    bad addresses
    inconsistent parsing
