Subject: trying to scrape MG&E residential data

Hello Paul,

Through my work on campus around Livable Cities, I've heard a lot of people
thinking about how to use hi-res energy data in their work. Some mention
how difficult it is to get MG&E to share data, and I've heard others remark
how simple it is. Often people are talking about different data, but MG&E
does have a web interface to a database of residential gas and electric
usage by address. Here is the website with a sample query with terms house
number, street direction, street name, street status(?), auxiliary unit,
and city.

I'm contacting you to ask about finding someone to help scrape this data
and link it to parcel-level tax info on homes. If we were able to get
parcel data fro the Robbins map library...

Is this the type of thing ACI could assist on? How long do you think it
would take? Do you know other contacts on campus who might be able to help
(student hackers)?

We were thinking about using this data with dense temperature data we have
for the City of Madison since 2012 to look at local heat islands,
vegetation and energy use, but there are plenty of people on campus who
would run with this if it existed. BTW, do you know if this already exists?
Maybe someone has done the difficult work of prying it from MG&E already.

Hope you are well and thanks for your attention on this.

Jason
