Welcome to the Vargo repository! I hope you will be loving it!

To run the MGE data scraper simply clone Vargo into your home
directory and run `~/Vargo/DataScraper/bash/MGE`.

```
#!/bin/bash
## Set the location of the Vargo repository
DIR=$HOME # Mine is in my home directory
cd $DIR/Vargo/DataScraper/
make MGE
```
